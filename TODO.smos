  - See if we have to use something other than appendful for syncing
  - Do the filtering in a request, so it doesn't take ages on many long messages while

  - Only sync commands that are finished or old
  - Consider exit code zero more important
  - Show multi-line commands
  - Session ID so we can reproduce sessions
